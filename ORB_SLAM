1. 
	each time change basgrc do: 

	source ~/.bashrc
	
2. after install ROS, do all the things in beginner tutorial, like mkdir catkin_ws and intialize rosdep

3. when we try to 'git clone' ORB_SLAM2 on the internet, it always fail to compile, but before we delete the package file
   we should deletet the folder build and devel(under catkin_ws) as well, after delete thoes two, run catkin_make in catkin_ws. 

4. 
	every packages have different way to compile,
	instead of catkin_make, there are cmake

	mkdir build
	cd build 
	cmake ..

	then install

	cd build 
	sudo make install

and there is third way to compil, just like the one we use in ORB_SLAM2
chod +x build.sh

3. ORB_SLAM2

1.	first doing '2. Prerequisites'
	we can ignore 'C++11 or C++0x Compiler'
	we can skip the openCV install
	we can skip DBoW2 and g2o
	we can skip ‘binding’

2.	about the Pangolin:
	!!!!!!!must git clone under ‘home’ not catkin_ws
	we need to install the dependencies and recommand dependences in Pangolin, for brand new ubuntu, we need to install them before the git clone（the ‘building’） 

3.	about the Eigen3
	click the link, download from the very top 'The latest stable release is Eigen 3.3.5. Get it here: tar.bz2, tar.gz, zip. Changelog.' (click zip), double click the zip and extract it in folder 'home'
	then the install instruction is in side of the zip, unzip it at the folder 'home' 

Do:
	 cd eigen (tab)
	 mkdir build_dir
	 cd build_dir
	 cmake ..
	 sudo make install
	 
	 (the above three line just an other wat to compile a package, the ORB_SLAM2 need this kind of compile, but this method just one of the methods of compile package, and 
		just the same as the
    mkdir build
    cd build 
    cmake ..

    then install

    cd build 
    sudo make install  
    or
    catkin_make
	)

5. cannot find packages.
	we follow the exactly step on how to install ros on ubuntu. but we dont know that:
	1.	ubuntu 14 -> indigo
	2. 	ubuntu 16 -> kinetic
	3.  ODROID 	  -> need ubuntu mate 
	4.  when downloading image files for odroid, search ubuntu mate image odroid and search the lasted version,https://odroid.in/ubuntu_16.04lts/
	
6. add these line in bashrc

	source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
	source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash	
	export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:~/catkin_ws/src/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS
	then doing 
	source ~/.bashrc

7.	when compileing the ORB_SLAM2, it take a loooooooot of time, sometime, it stuck on 59% or some, 
	but as long as it was not showing error, then just give it more times.

8. 	doing the '3. Building ORB_SLAM2 library and example' doesnt work, we use the package file from Rene, we save the file in folder'files for ROS study' 
	and do the command in '3. Building ORB_SLAM2 library and example'
